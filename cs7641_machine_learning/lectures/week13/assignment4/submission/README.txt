4) notebook=7.0.8
5) numpy=1.26.4
6) pandas=2.2.1

Step to replicate results:
1) If Conda is not already installed, you can download here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html
2) In the zip file you'll find CS7641_A4_ScottSchmidl.yml
3) From the terminal run: conda env create --file scottschmidl_A4.yml
4) From the terminal run: conda activate scottschmidl_A4
5) Create a directory, for example scott_schmidl_A4
9) You should now be able to run the Python scripts named: run_bj.py, run_fl_l.py, and run_fl_s.py. These will run and also generate several CSV's. If you desire to run the notebooks instead, which use the CSV's. Those notebooks are fl_L.ipynb, fl_S.ipynb, bj.ipynb,
